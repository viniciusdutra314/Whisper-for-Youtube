# Whisper-for-Youtube
Whisper-for-Youtube is a tool designed to generate subtitle files (.srt) for YouTube videos effortlessly. The subtitles will be saved on Google Colab or on Google Drive when desired. By simply providing the video links, you can easily create subtitles, and even download entire playlists. The videos will also be saved but on another folder
This functionality is powered by the [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) library.
## Google Colab
The code was intended to run on Google Colab due to the high performance required to run [Whisper OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper). To execute the code, please follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/viniciusdutra314/Whisper-for-all/blob/main/whisper-for-yt.ipynb).
